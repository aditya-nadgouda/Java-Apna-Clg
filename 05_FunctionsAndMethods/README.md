input -> Operation -> Output

## Syntax 
<pre>
`_access_modifier_ _static/non-static_ return_type function_name (type arg1, type arg2,...){
//operations
}`
</pre>

int sum = a +b;
sout (sum);
}`

## Note :
- In java, we can return only single value (int || float || string ...)
- return type : "**VOID**" : Function does not return anything
- In java functions are stored in memory in **Stack** format
- Functions : When we call directly then we call it as function.
- Methods : When we call with using objects of class then we call it as methods.
